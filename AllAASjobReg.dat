The ARC Centre of Excellence for All-sky Astrophysics (""CAASTRO"") aims to establish Australia as a world-leader in wide-field optical and radio astronomy. CAASTRO is answering fundamental questions about the nature of the Universe, is developing innovative ways of processing enormous data sets, and is enabling a diverse set of opportunities for students and early career researchers. CAASTRO is a research partnership between The University of Sydney, The University of Melbourne, The Australian National University, Swinburne University of Technology, The University of Queensland, Curtin University and The University of Western Australia, the latter two operating as the joint venture, ICRAR. CAASTRO is also collaborating closely with the Australian Astronomical Observatory, CSIRO, and other Australian and international partners. CAASTRO supports the activities of over 160 researchers, administrative staff and students.
This position, based at Curtin University in Perth, is aimed at contributing to the detection of the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) signal with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The MWA is a low-frequency radio interferometer located in the Western Australian desert. The MWA EoR Collaboration has collected hundreds of hours of data on three southern EoR fields, and is developing and implementing two parallel pipelines to calibrate the data and compute the statistical signal from high redshift neutral hydrogen.
The position will be expected to contribute heavily to one or more of pipeline development/verification/refinement/optimisation, data processing and analysis, interpretation, and publication generation. The position will need to work closely as part of the Curtin EoR group and MWA team (including the operations team), the CAASTRO EoR group, and the broader MWA EoR Consortium.
The successful applicant will work on one of more of the following tasks:


		Support the development and refinement of the MWA EoR power spectrum algorithm and/or software pipeline led by Curtin University;

		Assess the impact of algorithm design decisions (e.g., foreground mitigation methods) and/or contaminated data (e.g., polarisation leakage) on EoR statistical detection;

		Assess differences between the two MWA EoR pipelines with reference to EoR detectability;

		Interact closely with the groups at the University of Melbourne, the ANU, and the University of Sydney, and internationally within the MWA collaboration for data analysis.

The position will be expected to visit other CAASTRO nodes as required (Sydney, ANU, and Melbourne), participate in CAASTRO and other EoR busy weeks, and participate in MWA project meetings. Depending on the person employed, some aspects of supporting actual MWA observations may be desirable, or else technical work on sub-systems such as the MWA Real-Time System. Alternatively, applicants with more of an interpretive or statistical skill-set would be welcome, to assist in the astrophysical interpretation of the data and connecting to theoretical efforts at Melbourne, or to contribute to understanding the optimal approach to the problem and the impact of design decisions.
This appointment will be for 3 years. CAASTRO supports a flexible working environment; subject to visa restrictions, this opportunity is available as either a full-time or part-time position.

The position will be for a three-year period with a starting date in the first part of 2015. We are flexible concerning the exact starting date. The application deadline is 1 December 2014.
The aim of the Stellar Astrophysics Centre (SAC) is to perform a coherent study of stars and planetary systems. The Centre addresses key aspects of stars, their surrounding environments and their planetary systems. From an observational point of view the study of the physics of stars and planetary systems is undergoing a revolution, thanks to recent and coming observational facilities, including the Kepler mission, the TESS mission, the PLATO mission, the James Webb Space Telescope and the Danish-led SONG network. The goal of the Centre is to ensure that full use is made of these possibilities to perform a coherent study of stars, their interiors, atmospheres, magnetic activity, environment and associated planetary systems, through the integration of several normally separate fields.
Important areas of work for the successful applicant may include research in stellar ages, evolution, rotation, mixing and convection. Analyses of stellar oscillations may be used to obtain information about stellar structure and evolution. There are very substantial uncertainties in the modelling of stellar evolution, largely caused by insufficient understanding of hydrodynamical processes in stellar interiors, including convection, the evolution of rotation and the related mixing processes. The successful applicant is expected to work on theoretical aspects of stars and stellar oscillations, which can include stellar microphysics, stellar magnetic fields, stellar winds and stellar magnetic cycles.
The Stellar Astrophysics Centre plays a leading role in the asteroseismic use of data from the NASA Kepler mission and in the ground-based SONG network for asteroseismic investigations. We have also access to telescopes through the Danish membership of European Southern Observatory (ESO) and the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT). The Centre staff is leading in modelling of stellar and solar structure and evolution. SAC has established direct research collaborations with research groups from Australia, USA, UK and Germany, which form an integral part of the Centre. The many visitors and the postdoc and PhD programme at SAC provide a vibrant working environment.
It is foreseen that the successful applicant will take part in the teaching activities in astrophysics and supervision of students (all teaching and supervision can be done in English). The amount of teaching will cover less than 20 per cent of the total working hours.
Further information about the position can be obtained from the head of SAC, Prof. Jrgen Christensen-Dalsgaard (jcd@phys.au.dk) or from the SAC Manager, Hans Kjeldsen (hans@phys.au.dk).

Deadline: 1 November 2014

The Radio Observatory division of ASTRON (the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy) invites applications for at least one Support Scientist position in the Science Support Group, that will open in 2015.
This position offers exciting opportunities for front-line research in radio astronomy, as well as for in-depth involvement in exploiting and developing highly innovative new observing facilities, realizing their full potential along with the first users. In particular, this position allows developing skills and novel experimental methods on a system using technologies which will ultimately contribute to the development of the SKA.
ASTRON operates the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), a cutting-edge, low-frequency, multi-field aperture array telescope that is using transformational technologies and novel software approaches. LOFAR has already entered its operational phase, and has started delivering scientific and unique data in the relatively unexplored spectral window below 200 MHz. ASTRON also operates the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT), an array of fourteen 25m radio telescopes with state-of-the-art instrumentation. APERTIF (APERture Tile In Focus), a next generation observing system using focal plane array technology, is being developed for the WSRT in order to significantly expand its field of view and its survey speed, enabling new, innovative types of astronomical research. The WSRT also participates in the European and Global VLBI Networks.
Appointees will spend time on support work as well as on their research. The balance and specific areas of emphasis will be initially agreed upon according to the profile and interests of the candidate; this may be reconsidered after the support scientist has gained experience with the possible areas of technical expertise and support and the research possibilities afforded by the Radio Observatory telescopes.
Depending on technical background and interests, the support responsibilities may include:


			Involvement in the development of new observing modes, software, or hardware.

			Testing of new equipment and capabilities.

			Providing technical expertise to users, advising and assisting them to design, prepare, run, process, and analyze observations.

			Monitoring of system performance.

			Overseeing the planning of astronomical projects and the telescope calendar.

The research of support scientists can be on any astrophysical or instrumental topic, although some component involving the use of LOFAR and/or the WSRT and/or allowing possibilities to collaborate with other ASTRON research staff is preferred. Astronomers at ASTRON are active in many frontline research areas: galaxy structure and evolution, the ISM and IGM, galaxy clusters and the ICM, pulsars and compact objects, the transient radio sky, AGN evolution and studies of the magnetic universe, large radio continuum and HI surveys, deep fields, and gravitational lensing. Other front-line research facilities available to astronomers employed in the Netherlands include the ESO-VLT(I), ALMA, JCMT and the ING telescopes. Access to excellent computational facilities and travel support is available.
Depending on experience and skills, this appointment is typically offered as a starters position for two years, with an extension to a third year based on good performance, and the possibility for longer extension in exceptional cases. The position requires a PhD in astronomy, astrophysics or other related discipline. Affinity with instrumentation or software is also valued. A good command of the English language (writing and speaking) is essential.

Letters of application should be sent to personnel@astron.nl. The search will continue until the position is filled; applications arriving before the deadline of 1 November 2014 will be assured of full consideration. Applications should include a CV, scientific interests, a research proposal and three letters of reference. Please refer to vacancy nr. 2014-09-038.
Successful candidates will be in the formal employment of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), at a salary scale commensurate with age and experience. Generous relocation expenses, as well as an excellent package of benefits and assistance with finding accommodation will be provided (see also www.astron.nl/about-astron/careers/careers). Applicants of any nationality are eligible to apply. Their work place will be the ASTRON headquarters, located in Dwingeloo (the Netherlands).

The Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics (BCCP) at UC Berkeley is pioneering a new Cosmology Data-Science Initiative, with one or more positions available at all levels from post-doctoral through senior scientist, depending on experience. The members of this group will explore a novel approach to Cosmology Data Science (CDS): Each CDS Fellow will have half their research devoted to a specific cosmology project of the BCCP, working as a scientist in a research group with all of the expected goals of project planning, data collection, data reduction/analysis, publication, and conference-presentation of results. The other half of each CDS Fellows research will examine the data-science steps needed to accomplish these science goals, and look for approaches to redesigning these steps and make current and future science projects progress faster and more reliable. Questions that the CDS Initiative intends to address include: What are the current data science steps that are slowing down the scientists and/or distracting them from their primary science questions? What aspects make it difficult for a new member of a research team to come up to speed and begin contributing quickly? Why is it difficult to benefit from software that was written for a previous project, or by a previous member of the science team? For this data-science half of the CDS Fellows research, the Fellows will work not just individually, but also together as a CDS Initiative team, with the goal of finding or inventing common solutions to the problems and opportunities that they identify. The CDS team will also meet regularly with Data Science Fellows in other fields at UC Berkeley.
The CDS Fellows will have the opportunity to interact and work with the broad spectrum of cosmology researchers in the Berkeley Astronomy and Physics Departments, and at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The experimental and observational cosmology programs at Berkeley include supernovae, galaxy clustering (including baryonic acoustic oscillations), weak lensing and cosmic microwave background, in addition to a broad theoretical cosmology research program. Information on the BCCP's current activities and membership may be found at the BCCP's website: bccp.berkeley.edu. The Fellows will also find a rich data-science environment at UC Berkeley and LBNL, with world-expert researchers in both computer science and domain science aspects of this emerging field.
Candidate should have obtained Ph.D. or equivalent in physics, astrophysics or a related field before their appointment start date and ideally should have several years of postdoctoral experience. We are looking for individuals with strong scientific research experience, ideally in cosmology, as well as strong interest and experience in data science approaches. We plan to make one or more new Cosmology Data-Science Initiative Fellow appointments, in addition to the existing three. The positions are for two years initially, with the possibility of extension of up to three additional years, subject to a performance review. Further extensions beyond this may be possible subject to availability of funds.
To apply, submit a copy of your curriculum vitae, bibliography, and statement of cosmology and data science research interests to https://aprecruit.berkeley.edu/apply/JPF00562. To receive full consideration please send the material by December 1, 2014, but later applications may also be considered until all the positions are filled. At least 3 letters of reference should also be submitted by the same date. For further inquiries contact BCCP directors Uros Seljak at useljak@berkeley.edu and Saul Perlmutter at saul@lbl.gov. For inquiries of administrative nature, contact Melissa Barclay at mbarclay@berkeley.edu. Salary will be commensurate with experience at or above a typical postdoctoral salary.

ICRAR is one of the lead Australian organisations participating in the international SKA Project and has been funded under an ICRAR2 grant from 2014/15 to 2018/19 with $26 Million from the WA State Government.
	UWA graduate Dr Jim Buckee, who gained a BSc Honours at UWA in 1967 and a PhD in Astrophysics at Britains Oxford University in 1970, has generously endowed a new research position at UWA that will play a key role in the SKA project.
	ICRAR is looking for a highly motivated scientist to apply for the prestigious Jim Buckee Fellowship in Astrophysics to undertake research in supercomputer modelling of the formation and evolution of galaxies in the cosmic web, and to make predictions that can be tested with next generation radio telescopes such as the SKA. Applicants must have a PhD in radio astronomy or related discipline.
This is a 3-year appointment.
Over the coming decade, large surveys on cutting-edge radio telescopes, culminating with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), will provide unique insights into the distribution of gas on both galactic and cosmological scales over the last several billion years of cosmic time. The results of these surveys will revolutionise our understanding of the physical processes that drive galaxy formation and evolution, including star formation and feedback from stars and accreting super-massive black holes, while also revealing, for example, the fate of the so-called missing baryons in the cosmic web. Cosmological galaxy formation simulations provide a powerful tool for the design and interpretation of these surveys, and efforts are underway at ICRAR/UWA to develop both the simulations and analysis framework to support these surveys. The successful Jim Buckee Fellow in Astrophysics will play a key role in these efforts, developing and implementing galaxy formation models in cosmological simulations on state-of-the-art supercomputers and creating synthetic observational datasets from these simulated datasets to pit the model predictions against current and future observations. The project will require expertise in theoretical and computational astrophysics, statistical analysis and high performance computing.

Lund observatory is deeply involved in Gaia and related galactic science. We now seek to hire a PhD student to study the physics of stellar clusters using Gaia observations.
Stellar clusters are the birthplaces of stars, and close encounters within clusters can change the properties of both binary stars and planetary systems. The student will combine data from Gaia and ground-based spectroscopic surveys with theoretical models to understand the astrophysics of stellar clusters and the stars within them. Stellar clusters are important not only as the birthplaces of stars but are also used as testbeds for stellar dynamics, evolution and nucleosynthesis: they have ramifications across astrophysics from planetary systems to galactic chemical evolution. The PhD student will use Gaia data directly to probe the recent dynamical histories of stellar clusters and the properties of binary stars within them. This information will be used to test and improve theoretical models of cluster dynamics and evolution.
The PhD student will be based at Lund Observatory, which is part of the Department of Astronomy and Theoretical Physics at Lund University. Research at the Observatory includes work on stellar populations, exoplanets, high energy astrophysics and research related to Gaia, in particular the astrometric solution, which is led by Lund.

Organisation Background
	The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is a global project to build a multi-purpose radio telescope that will play a major role in answering key questions in modern astrophysics and cosmology. It will be one of a small number of cornerstone observatories around the world that will provide astrophysicists and cosmologists with a transformational view of the Universe. The SKA will be constructed in two distinct phases. Some of the major science goals for the first phase, SKA1, will be to study the history and role of neutral Hydrogen in the Universe from the dark ages to the present-day, and to employ pulsars as probes of fundamental physics.
	Since 2008, the global radio astronomy community has been engaged in the development of the SKA as a major part of the Preparatory phase of the project. The Preparatory phase ended in December 2011 and, following a number of major changes, the international SKA project has now progressed to the Pre-Construction phase (2012-15) with the establishment of a new legal entity, the SKA Organisation, on 14 December 2011. Eleven governments are now participating in the project, with others engaged in discussions concerning possible membership. The SKA Organisation is now headquartered in a purpose-built building at Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire, UK.
General Description
	The Office of the SKA Organisation (SKA Office) will lead the SKA system design and oversee the detailed design being undertaken within the globally distributed SKA work packages (WPs). To accomplish this goal the SKA Office is employing highly qualified scientists and engineers, project managers and system engineers. Work packages for the major SKA subsystems (elements) have been contracted to a small number of work package consortia who are responsible for the management, execution and delivery of the work packages. The technical strategy and philosophy of the project are strongly based on system engineering principles.
	SKA Project Scientist
	We are seeking applicants for one Project Scientist position to add the current team of three Project Scientists. The Project Scientists report to the SKA Science Director as part of a small, highly competent Science Team. They form a critical part of the SKA Office team leading the detailed design of the SKA. They work with system engineers and project managers in the SKA Office, and with colleagues in the work-package consortia to ensure that the emerging design of the SKA is compatible with achieving the ambitious science goals of the project.
	The Science Team is expected to engage with the global science community and serve as advocates of the SKA within both the radio astronomy and the broader astronomical community and provide a conduit to understand and contribute to the science goals of the SKA. It is expected that the Project Scientists are active researchers, with an interest in the key science areas to be explored by the SKA.
Within the SKA Office, the Project Science Team is expected to:
	 lead the development of the SKA science requirements and play a major role in the development of the concept of operations,
	 lead the effort to evaluate technical trade-offs against the science requirements and assess the impact on the SKA science case,
	 provide the scientific oversight in the process of translating scientific goals into technical requirements,
	 engage and work with the SKA Office technical teams to ensure that the SKA will deliver maximal science within the boundaries and constraints of the project.
	 25% of time will be available for research. 
Essential qualifications, experience, and attributes:
	 a PhD or equivalent, in astronomy, physics, or closely related field,
	 research experience at postdoctoral level,
	 experience with large astronomical science projects
	 ability to form an effective interface between science and engineering teams,
	 good communication skills,
	 demonstrated experience of ability to present SKA work in international and otherforums,
	 ability to work effectively with SKA scientists from a variety of cultures
	 willingness to travel on behalf of SKA Organisation.
