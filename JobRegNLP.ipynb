        "Johns Hopkins University  Asst. Research ScientistWe are seeking a postdoctoral research scientist with a strong background in scientific software development to be a member of the Johns Hopkins University, Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Science (IDIES) research and development project teams. The ideal candidate must have the vision and creativity to find innovative solutions to the Big Data challenges that these projects entail, as well as the rigor and experience to develop high-quality application software to address these challenges. The selected candidate will be responsible for the design, development, testing and deployment of the suite of scientific software applications developed in the JHU Physics and Astronomy department. They will act as the technical lead on the projects they work on, in particular the NSF funded SciServer project, which aims to build a long term flexible, reusable and scalable framework to access to the enormous data sets in fields ranging from observational astronomy (the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to the Large Synoptic Survey telescope) and genomics to the simulation data generated by the largest scale simulations in astronomy, mechanical engineering and fluid dynamics (e.g., turbulence), materials science and brain science.For more information please visit: http://idies.jhu.edu/news/idies-open-position-%E2%80%93-postdoctoral-res...Johns Hopkins University is an EO/AA employer committed to recruiting, supporting, and fostering a diverse community.

        "The Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) invites applications for an open-level position in observational astronomy/cosmology. Preference will be given to candidates at senior levels, but more junior candidates with demonstrated leadership capabilities will also be considered. We are particularly interested in applicants with experience and on-going research programs related to emerging fields or facilities e.g. thirty meter class telescopes, dark energy missions (EUCLID/WFIRST), James Webb Space Telescope, big data, exo-planets.The successful candidate will be expected to establish an outstanding and well-funded research program involving graduate students and post-doctoral scientists and be capable of leading the UCR astronomy group in new directions. He/She will have access to the resources of the University of California Observatories, which include the two 10-meter Keck Telescopes and the Lick Observatory. The astronomy group at UCR consists of six faculty, 25 graduate students and 6 post-doctoral scientists, active in a wide range of areas, including: formation and evolution of galaxies, high redshift universe, dark matter and dark energy, large scale structure, active galactic nuclei, galaxy clusters, galaxy surveys, theoretical astrophysics and numerical simulations. Members of the UCR astronomy group are playing leading roles in several large projects and are involved in TMT instrumentation studies. UCR is a member of Southern California Center for Galaxy Evolution (CGE) and High Performance Astro-Computing Center (HiPACC).Candidates for this position are required to have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in astronomy, physics, or a related field. Salary will be competitive and commensurate with qualification. Applicants should submit curriculum vitae, list of publications, a statement of research and teaching objectives, and contact information for at least four professional references to the AP Recruit site at http://aprecruit.ucr.edu/apply. For enquiries, please contact the search committee chair (Prof. Bahram Mobasher mobasher@ucr.edu) or any of the UCR astronomy faculty. Review of applications will commence on 1st December 2014 and will continue until the position is filled.The University of California is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer committed to excellence through diversity.\n",
